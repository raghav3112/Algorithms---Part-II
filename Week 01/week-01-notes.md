## Week 1: Undirected Graphs

> We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graphâ€”depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.

### Introduction to Graphs
* *Graph* - set of **vertices** connected pairwise by **edges**
* Why study graph algorithms?
  * Thousands of practical applications
  * Hundreds of graph algorithms known
  * Interesting and broadly useful abstraction
  * Challenging branch of computer science and discrete math
* *Path* - sequence of vertices connected by edges
* *Cycle* - path whose first and last vertices are the same
* Two vertices are **connected** if there is a path between them
