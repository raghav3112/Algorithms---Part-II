## Week 1: Undirected Graphs

> We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graphâ€”depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.

### Introduction to Graphs
* *Graph* - set of **vertices** connected pairwise by **edges**
* Why study graph algorithms?
  * Thousands of practical applications
  * Hundreds of graph algorithms known
  * Interesting and broadly useful abstraction
  * Challenging branch of computer science and discrete math
* *Path* - sequence of vertices connected by edges
* *Cycle* - path whose first and last vertices are the same
* Two vertices are **connected** if there is a path between them

### Graph API
* *Graph drawing* - provides intuition about the structure of the graph (however, intuition can be misleading)
* *Vertex representation*:
  * In this lecture we will use integers between 0 and *V - 1*
  * In application, we convert between names and integers with a symbol table

* The typical graph API is as follows:
```java
public class Graph {
  // Create an empty graph with V vertices
  Graph(int V) {}

  // Create a graph from input stream
  Graph(In in) {}

  // Add an edge v-w
  void addEdge(int v, int w) {}

  // Vertices adjacent to v
  Iterable<Integer> adj(int v) {}

  // Number of vertices
  int V() {}

  // Number of edges
  int E() {}

  // String representation
  String toString() {}
}
```

* Adjacency-matrix graph representation requires a two-dimensional *V-by-V* boolean array, where each edge *v-w* in graph: `adj[v][w] == adj[w][v]` returns true
* The Java implementation for the adjacency-list graph representation is as follows:
```java
public class Graph {
  // Use bag data type
  private final int V;
  private Bag<Integer>[] adj;

  // Create empty graph with V vertices
  public Graph(int V) {
    this.V = V;
    adj = (Bag<Integer>[]) new Bag[V];
    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) {
      adj[v] = new Bag<Integer>();
    }
  }

  // Add edge v-w
  public void addEdge(int v, int w) {
    adj[v].add(w);
    adj[w].add(v);
  }

  // Iterator for vertices adjacent to v
  public Iterable<Integer> adj(int v) {
    return adj[v];
  }
}
```

* In practice, use adjacency-lists representation:
  * Algorithms based on iterating over vertices adjacent to *v*
  * Real-world graphs tend to be **sparse** (huge number of vertices, small average vertex degree)
