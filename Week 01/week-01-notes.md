## Week 1: Undirected Graphs

> We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graphâ€”depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.
