## Week 2: Minimum Spanning Trees

> In this lecture we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We begin by considering a generic greedy algorithm for the problem. Next, we consider and implement two classic algorithm for the problemâ€”Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. We conclude with some applications and open problems.
