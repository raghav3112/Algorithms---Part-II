| sorting    | quicksort, mergesort, heapsort                     | part I  |
| searching  | BST, red-black BST, hash table                     | part I  |
| graphs     | BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra                  | part II |
| strings    | radix sorts, tries, KMP, regexps, data compression | part II |
