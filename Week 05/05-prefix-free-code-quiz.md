## Quiz 5: Prefix-free Codes

* *Identify an optimal uniquely-decodable code that is neither prefix free nor suffix free*
* *Identify two optimal prefix-free codes for the same input that have a different distribution of code-word lengths*

A: The answers are as follows:
* {00, 10, 11} is a *fix-free* code - it is neither a prefix or suffix to some other code-word
* {000, 100, 110, 111} and {0, 10, 110, 111}
