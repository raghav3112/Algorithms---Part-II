## Quiz 5: Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem

*Consider the polyhedron P defined by:*

$$
  \sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1, \sum_{j} x_{ij} = 1, x_{ij} \geq 1
$$

*Prove that all extreme points of P have integer coordinates (0 or 1).*

A: Because both summations must sum to 1 and x must be greater than or equal to zero the only two extreme points of *P* must be 0 or 1
