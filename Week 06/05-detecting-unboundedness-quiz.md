## Quiz 5: Detecting unboundedness

*Describe how to modify the simplex algorithm to detect an unbounded linear program â€” a linear program in which there is a feasible solution that makes the objective function arbitrarily large.*

A: We have to add a check for a feasible solution in the feasibility region as well as check if the objective function becomes large with those values
