## Quiz 8: Decision Problems

*Given an undirected graph with positive edge weights, the traveling salesperson problem is to find a simple cycle that visits every vertex and has minimum total weight. The search problem version of the problem is, given a parameter **L**, find a tour of length at most **L**. Prove that the optimization version of the problem polynomial-time reduces to the search version of the problem.*

*Remark: for many problems such as this one, the optimization version of the problem (which is not known to be in **NP**) is solvable in polynomial time if and only if the search version of the problem (which is easily seen to be in **NP**) is.*

A: Since the search version of the traveling sales person is not NP (does not run in poly-time) the optimization version of the traveling sales person problem is also not NP.
