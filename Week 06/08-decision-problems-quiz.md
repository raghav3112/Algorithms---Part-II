## Quiz 8: Decision Problems

*Traditionally, the complexity classes **P** and **NP** are defined in terms of decision problems (where the answer is either yes or no) instead of search problems (where the answer is the solution itself). Prove that the search problem version of SAT (find a binary solution to a given system of boolean equations?) polynomial-time reduces to the decision version of SAT (does there exists a binary solution to a given system of boolean equations?)*

A: There does exist a binary solution to a given system of boolean equations (see lecture slides).
