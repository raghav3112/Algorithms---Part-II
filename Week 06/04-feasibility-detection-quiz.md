## Quiz 4: Feasibility detection

*Suppose that you want to solve a linear program but you don't have a starting initial basic feasible solutionâ€”perhaps the all 0 vector is not feasible. Design a related linear program whose solution will be a basic feasible solution to the original linear program (assuming the original linear program has a basic feasible solution).*

A: If *a* is an all zero vector and *a* is not a basic feasible solution, then *LP* - the linear program - must have a basic feasible solution *b* which is not *a*
